# Pokemon_Analysis

This project uses following modules:-
1. Pandas module is used for data processing and reading csv file.
2. Matplotlib is used to plot data. Plots used in this project are Line Plot, Scatter Plot and Histogram.
3. Seaborn module is used as visulization tool.

In this project I have ploted the Line Plot, Scatter Plot and Histogram. You can use anyone one the plots as per your convenience.

Firstly we fetch the information about the csv file using .info() function then will be find the correlation of given data using .corr() function.
Then we will plot the correlation map using the heatmap from seaborn module.
Now we will plot the Line Plot for given data which gives us the Speed Vs Defense Line Plot of all the Pokemon's present in the csv file.
Then we plot a Attack Vs Defense Scatter Plot.
Finally we plot a Histogram for the given data.
